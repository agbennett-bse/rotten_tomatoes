# Rotten Tomatoes Movie Review Dataset

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to understand the Rotten Tomatoes dataset and bias in the BERT model. 

### Methods Used
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* BERT
* Binary Classification
* RNN

### Technologies
* Python

## Project Description
In this project, we look at different models and the impact of those model on TP and FP. We try to create optimizations based on what we see from the data, and identify potential biases in our model. 

Below is a graph comparing the model performances and different LLM techniques employed to classify positive and negative rotten tomato movie reviews.
